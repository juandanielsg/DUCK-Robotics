# ur10e-control

This project is a intuitive and user-friendly approach to cartesian control for the UR10e robot arm. The aim of the project is to add visual servoing and pose control from scratch using Python as the main language.

To improve this project:
- Port to C++ (I am not going to do this, but would gladly allow anyone to do it and commit to this repository if they manage to do so - JD)


Current benchmarks:
- Average loop speed: 0.0045s
- Average loop speed (launch): 0.0088s
